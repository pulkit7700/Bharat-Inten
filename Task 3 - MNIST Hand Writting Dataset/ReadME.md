## Introduction

This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning. The goal is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately predict the digits based on their images.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn (for t-SNE visualization)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Handwriting-Classification-CNN
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred development environment.
2. The code consists of the following main sections:
   - Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST dataset
   - Visualizing Sample Images
   - Visualizing using t-SNE
   - Building and Training the CNN Model

## Results

The trained CNN model should achieve a high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset. The t-SNE visualization provides insights into the distribution of data points in a lower-dimensional space, highlighting the clusters formed by different digits.
